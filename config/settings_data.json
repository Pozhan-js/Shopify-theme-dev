Our mission is to offer a diverse selection of Feng Shui elements, enabling you to create an arrangement that aligns with your individual energy.</p><h1><strong>Our Story: The First Piece of the Puzzle</strong></h1><p>The first piece of our puzzle was laid by our founder, Mollie Yang. With a degree in Landscape Architecture from San Francisco and 7 years in the building industry, she observed a powerful truth: the design and energy of a home directly shape the lives of those within it. It was during a visit to a friend’s cramped apartment in the city, where the afternoon light barely pierced through the cluttered decor, that an idea took root. In envisioning the space transformed into a serene haven, Mollie felt the undeniable energy shift that could result—an insight that set the foundation for Puzzle Zen.</p><p>This insight sparked a quest to move beyond traditional design and explore the ancient art of Feng Shui. Mollie wondered: if everyone's energy is different,why are Feng Shui solutions so often one-size-fits-all? This question became the cornerstone of Puzzle Zen.</p><h1><strong>Our Expert Team: Your Guides to the Puzzle</strong></h1><p>To support your journey, we have assembled a team of experienced professionals:</p><p>•Our Feng Shui Architect specializes in conducting in-depth home energy checkups.Using a unique approach, they assess your space to spot areas where energy is blocked and identify opportunities, providing a straightforward plan forachieving harmony in your environment.<br/><br/>•Our Destiny Analyst is an expert in the logical and precise Northern School IChing.

          "title": "Feng Shui FAQs",
          "content": "<p><strong>Q1: What exactly is Feng Shui?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Feng Shui is a 3,000-year-old practice from China that focuses on environmental harmony. It involves arranging spaces to balance natural energy, known as \"Qi,\" to create a flow similar to \"acupuncture for your home.\" </p><p><strong>Q2: Do I need to be Chinese or have a spiritual background to benefit?</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>Not at all. Feng Shui relies on psychological and physical principles. For example, clutter blocking doors can lead to subconscious stress, while clearing it can result in mental ease. No<br/>specific beliefs are required! </p><p><strong>Q3: What is the \"Bagua Map\"?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> The Bagua Map is an energy blueprint that divides spaces into nine zones, such as career, relationships, and health. Aligning items in these areas supports specific life goals, acting as a<br/>productivity hack for your space. </p><p><strong>Q4: Are crystals and cures magical?</strong></p><p><strong>A: </strong>No, they serve as psychological anchors. For instance, having a brass abacus on your desk can remind you to manage your resources wisely. Crystals reflect light (or energy) and can shift your focus—they are tools, not talismans. </p><p><strong>Q5:How quickly does Feng Shui work?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Changes can be felt immediately (for example, decluttering can lead to mental clarity). However, deeper shifts may take from three weeks to three months, like planting seeds that need time to grow. Consistency is important! </p><p><strong>Q6: Can Feng Shui conflict with my religion?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Feng Shui is not a religion; rather, it focuses on harnessing spatial energy. For example, choosing a sunny desk can enhance your focus. Many individuals from various religions, including Christians, Jews, and Muslims, practice Feng Shui in a neutral way. </p><p><strong>Q7: Why focus on doors and windows?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Doors are considered the \"mouths of Qi\" (energy entry), while windows are the \"eyes\" (awareness).
