Think of it as:<br/></p><p><strong>“Acupuncture for Your Space”</strong> – Just as acupuncture unblocks energy in the body, Feng Shui optimizes energy in your home or office.</p><p><strong>“Mindful Design”</strong> – It combines ecology, psychology, and design to reduce stress and increase abundance.</p><p>** backed by the <em>I Ching</em> (The Book of Changes)** – Feng Shui is rooted in one of the world’s oldest philosophical systems, emphasizing balance (Yin-Yang) and the five elements (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal,<br/>Water).<br/><br/><br/></p>",
