We do not accept the collection (the warehouse can be refunded after the inspection is correct, the product that affects the secondary sales will not be refunded)</p><p>3.       Lost package refers to: the tracking information has not been updated for a long time, and the package display is abnormal.</p><p>You need to provide complete English screenshots of the order from the platform (partial or unclear screenshots may be considered invalid). The screenshots must clearly show your delivery address, tracking number, and order value. Once we successfully file the claim, we can offer a full refund or resend the item. If you are unable to provide the required proof, we won’t be able to process your request.</p><p>4． If the address of the parcel needs to be changed in transit</p><p>You’ll need to cover the handling fee for the address change. Please note that the change is not guaranteed to be successful, and the fee will still apply even if the update fails.</p><h2><strong>Once the goods are received</strong></h2><p>1.       If the packaging or products are damaged, please refuse to accept the delivery. If you choose to sign for it, you must promptly provide photos of the outer box, the shipping label, and the damaged items. Compensation will be issued based on the extent of the damage. If the products are damaged beyond use, we can either resend them free of charge or issue a full refund. If there is no feedback after signing and the product is not returned, we won’t be able to offer a refund unless the returned item is received and inspected by the warehouse. In such cases, the return shipping cost will be the customer’s responsibility.</p><p>2.       The dolls stored in overseas warehouses are made of TPE material, and their facial makeup is hand-painted, which may gradually fade or come off. Makeup loss during use is not considered a quality issue.</p><p>3.       The sex dolls are built with standard skeletons that are durable but not unbreakable. The range of poses is limited to what a normal person can safely do. Please refer to the user manual for guidance on proper handling and posing.</p><p>4.       Product quality complaints must be submitted within 7 days of receipt; after that, we will not be able to process them.</p><p>5.       Due to the nature of our products as private health items, we do not accept returns or exchanges without a valid reason. Only quality issues are eligible for replacement or compensation.</p><p>6.    If you return the parcel without prior authorization, the warehouse may be unable to locate it. Additionally, if the return affects the product’s resale condition, no compensation will be provided.</p>",
