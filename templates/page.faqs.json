For hygiene reasons, personal health products cannot be returned without a valid reason. If there is a quality issue, we’ll be happy to offer a replacement or appropriate compensation. Please note that unauthorized returns may not be traceable by the warehouse, and if the item is found to be unsellable, we may not be able to provide a refund or compensation. If the packaging or product is damaged, please refuse the delivery. If you've already signed for it, please provide photos of the outer box, shipping label, and the damaged product as soon as possible. Compensation will be based on the level of damage—if the product is unusable, we can offer a free replacement or a full refund. Unauthorized returns after signing may not be refunded. If the returned item is found unusable, the customer will be responsible for return shipping and disposal fees.</p>"

While they usually arrive together, they might sometimes arrive at different times.If there’s no tracking update for an extended period and the package appears abnormal, we’ll need a full screenshot of the order in English from the platform (partial screenshots are not accepted). The screenshot must clearly show your shipping address, tracking number, and order value. Once we submit a claim, we can offer a full refund or resend the item. Unfortunately, packages without the required proof cannot be processed.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Quality issues must be reported within 3 days after delivery. We’re unable to handle claims submitted after this period. If the product is damaged, we’ll offer compensation based on the severity. If it’s completely unusable, we can resend it for free or provide a full refund. The nails are attached with glue and may come off. The warehouse can resend the nails and glue, and you can reattach them yourself. Please note that the face makeup is hand-painted. If it fades during use, this is not considered a quality issue.</p>"
